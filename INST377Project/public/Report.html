      <h2>Problem we want to solve</h2>
      <span>
        The areas within PG county have experienced various forms of crime since
        2017. Some of those crimes are reported to the authorities, while others
        just go unrecorded. This leaves a gap of knowledge for current and
        potential residents on current activities that are occurring. Citizens
        should have access to a resource that shows an updated map of any crime
        activity, along with the ability to report crime(s) occurring within
        their area.
      </span>

      <h3>No link to where our app is running required</h3>
      <p>no link</p>
      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <span>
        General citizens within the county are stakeholders that are affected by
        the problem. This problem can also affect potential residents interested
        in moving within the county, researching how safe certain areas are
        within the various neighborhoods.
      </span>


      <h3>Data</h3>
      <span> The data we chose to work with is from the Prince George County Website, it showcases the crime history in Prince George from 2017 to present. 
        The data does not represent every call for a service handled by PG County Police. The data includes data from traffic accidents, asssaults, burglaries, homicides, 
        robberies,
        sex offenses, stolen vehicles, theft, and vandalism where a report has been written. 
        Included information for any of these events has been modified to remove specific address location. In order to provide victim confidentiality, 
        address numbers have been rounded to closest hundred block and any mapped locations will show occurrence based on the street centerline </span>
        
        <h3> *******Chosen Strategies and Solutions******* </h3>
        <span>We decided to graphically display the locations as well as the type of crime reported in PG County from 2017 to present. We believe that this tool will help
        PG residents as well as people who want to move into PG County. We have implemented a form that people can fill out to report/add more incidents that the database has missed. </span>

        <h3> Technical System Decision Rationale </h3>


        <h3> How/if your final system helps to address the problem</h3>


        <h3> Challenges faced and impact on final design </h3>



        <h3> Possible future work directions with this problem </h3>
        <span>In the future we would like to continue working on this project by expanding to other counties in Maryland, it would be of great help for residents in MD as well as people from other
        states that would like to move in. This tool could also come in handy to law enforcement in case they want to investigate possible patterns and crime history in certain areas. </span>
