## Information Problem
The citizens of Prince George's County should be able to see crime statistics of the county in a visual format. The current data format is in one large file that keeps growing. Residents need a tool that allows them to view crime occurrences of all types throughout the county. They also need an outlet to report crimes anonymously, especially if they don't feel comfortable contacting law enforcement. 

## Stakeholders/Target Browsers
Current and potential ressidents of the county may be interested in the crimes that occur. Depending on the progressiion of the application, law eforcement agencies may be interested in integrating the application into their systems to follow up on the anonymously reported crimes.
The application can be used by anny browser application on mobile and desktop devices. 

## Data
The data used to create this application is labled as [Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents-February-2017-to-Present/wb4e-w4nf/data) which we pulled from the [PGC Data Website](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/).

## Strategies and Solutions
In order to solver the probelm, we wanted to implement an interactive map that allowed users to view the locations of crimes. This tool allows the user to view the map in grayscale or street form, for accessbility purposes. Then, they can filter which crimes they want to see and which they want to hide. The user will also be able to report crimes anonymously through a form page. With these tools, users can sort through data using their preference. 
## Technical Decisions

## Evaluation
As a team, we felt as though our implementations met our goal to solve the information problem. With more time, there are a number of features we can add to improve user experience and website functionality. Nonethless, our collaborative efforts created an application that we are pleased to present.
