        <p>
          Our website is about solving the areas within PG county that have
          experiecned various forms of crime since 2017. We know that most of
          these crimes are reporrted to authorites, while many others aren't.
          Our misson is to create a website that lets citizens have access to
          resources that show on and updated map and also show many other crime
          activites, along with the ability to report crimes in certian areas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our website is for people that have crime in the area. This problem
          can also affect potential residents’ interest in moving with the
          country, researching how certain safe regions are within the various
          neighborhoods. This will give people the ability to be more
          knowledgeable and up to date about crimes within their community. The
          system that we have created will let users view a country map, showing
          any activities of crime. The users also have the ability to report a
          crime and upload details like date, time of the crime, location, and
          pictures.
          <br />
          <br />
          We chose to use the Prince George’s County open data API. This call
          this dataset “Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present”. We selected
          this dataset because it allows us to understand the crime occurrences
          across the county. It helps us create our main proposal, creating a
          map instance of crime.
